## 🧬 About This Repo

This repository originally contained hardware design files for two experimental devices:

- **OpenMuscle Labeler** – A handheld interface for labeling finger positions in machine learning datasets.
- **OpenMuscle Sensor Bracelet (OM-12)** – A pressure-based forearm sensor for capturing muscle signals.

These designs are preserved in their new locations above for better modularity and long-term maintainability.
